Simple shell project to code shell environment using C programming

Your Shell should:
Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
Handle errors.
You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
